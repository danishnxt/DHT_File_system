## Notes to self

    * Go will not export a function in a module unless It has a capital letter to begin with. 

    * I am guessing it is the same story for a struct as well

    * Files all linked into the same package most likely do not need uppercase - should be visible


## Style Guide

    Taken from Ubers Go repo: https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md

## What this is

    This is my first attempt at making a well setup and easy to maintain Go project. Specifically I will be attempting to make a chord based DHT file store. 

## TO DOs

    - Create Logger class
    - Create Macro for logging?
    - Does Go have Macros?

    - Should server and client be saved as objects/classes and have state?

## How to run 

    - Create directory called "DHT_NXT" in your GOPATH/src/ folder (or clone this repo with the same name)
    - go into dht/ folder and execute "go run dht_nxt_main.go"
    - This will create a basic node object and execute server client code to setup one instance of a chord node 

## Planned

    - Testing module for running tests on all network and non-network functionality 
    - Auto script to show sample running for overall project

## Who am I ? 

    Just another Gopher trying to Go better
