## Notes to self

    * Go will not export a function in a module unless It has a capital letter to begin with. 

    * I am guessing it is the same story for a struct as well

    * Files all linked into the same package most likely do not need uppercase - should be visible


## Style Guide

## What this is

    This is my first attempt at making a well setup and easy to maintain Go project. Specifically I will be attempting to make a chord based DHT file store. 

## Who am I ? 

    Just another Gopher trying to Go better
